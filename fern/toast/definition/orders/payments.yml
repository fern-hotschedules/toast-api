        Returns a list of the GUIDs for each payment made during
        one restaurant business day.
        The specific hours that make up a business
        day depend on the business day cutoff in the restaurant configuration,
        which is available from the restaurants API in the `closeoutHour`
        property.
        The business day for a restaurant is based on its local time (not UTC
        or local time for an API client).
        You must include one of the
        `paidBusinessDate`, `refundBusinessDate`, or `voidBusinessDate` query
        parameters.
