            docs: |
              An optional identifier that filters return values for a
              specific shift. The identifier can be a Toast platform GUID
              or an external identifier. If present, the shifts
              resource will only return the shifts you specify. You
              can include multiple `shiftIds` query parameters (maximum
              100).

            docs: |
              Optional start date and time of time period to match 
              shifts. A shift matches the time period if the shift 
              `inDate` is after (inclusive) the specified `startDate` and 
              the shift `outDate` is before the `endDate` (exclusive). 
              These parameters are required if the `shiftIds` parameter 
              is not defined. The specified period cannot be longer than 
              one month.

          endDate:
            docs: |

              after (inclusive) the specified `startDate` and the shift 
              `outDate` is before the `endDate` (exclusive). These 
              parameters are required if the `shiftIds` parameter is not 
              defined. The specified period cannot be longer than one
